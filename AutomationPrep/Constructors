Constructors is a block of code that initialixes the newly created object
Constructors name should be same as class name
Constructors can not have any return type
A Constructor can not be a static, final or abstract
Types of Constructors -> Default, No Arguments, Arguments
When we don't mention any constructor, the compiler itself creates a constructor called default constructor
No Arguments Constructor - allows us to provide some logic when object is created and it is not default constructor
Arguments Constructor - also same as No Arguments, however we can pass arguments here
Constructor Overloading - When we have both argument and non argument constructors in same class

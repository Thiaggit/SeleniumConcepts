ABSTRACTION

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details

Abstraction can be achieved by 
          1. Abstract Class (0 to 100 %)
          2. Interface (100%)
          
Abstract class
1. If a class is having an unimplemented method, then it should be declared as abstract. In other words, the abstract method should not have any implelementation
2. If a class is declared as abstract, it may have both abstract and non abstract methods
3. A class can be declared as abstract, even it does not have any abstract method
4. One cannot create an object for abstract class
5. The child class should implement all the abstract methods in the parent class. Otherwise, declare the child class as abstract also.


Interface
1. Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction
2. It is same as class whereas it only contains unimplemented or abstract method
3. By default, the method or variable declared in the interface is always public, static and final
4. One cannot create object for interface
5. A class can acquire interface by using implements keywords
6. A class can acquire more than one interface i.e., multilevel inheritance
7. An interface can acquire another interface using extends keyword

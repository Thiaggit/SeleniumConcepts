EXCEPTION HANDLING

An exception is an undesired or unexpected event which occurs during the execution of the program. It can be handled by our program
An error is not an exception and it is severe. It can ot be handled
Both exception and error are children of Throwable
There are two types of exceptions - Checked and Unchecked exception
Exceptions are handled by using try catch block

TRY CATCH
Try Block - block where we will write our code which cause exception
Catch Block - This is where the exceptions are handled
Catch block should be immediately followed by a Try block
A Try Block may have multiple catch blocks
If there are multiple catch blocks, they should not be of generic type
If there are no exceptions, then catch block will not be executed
In catch block, the top hierarchy exception -> Exception should be at the last catch block or it should be the only one 

FINALLY 
This blocks gets executed even if the exception occurs or not
There is no Finally block without try catch block
It is not mandatory
Finally block can also vulnerable to exception
Finally block will execute even if the try-catch block has return, break or continue
Finally block will not execute if
        1. The thread is dead
        2. When System.exit() is called
        3. When there is an unrecoverable exception in finally block itself

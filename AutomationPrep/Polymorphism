POLYMORPHISM
Polymorphism is the capability of the method to perform different things based on the object it is acted upon

Types
 1. Static/Compile/Method Overloading
 2. Dynamic/RunTime/Method Overriding
 
 OverLoading
 * The Method name should be same
 * The arguments should be different like no of arguments, datatypes etc
 * Happens in the same class and at compile time
 
 Overriding
 * The Method name should be different
 * It happens when there is an inheritance
 * When a child class wants to change few implementation or methods in the parent class, we use overriding

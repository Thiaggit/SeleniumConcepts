MAP

1.Map is a interface which was implemented by HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap
2.It is not a child interface of collection 
3.It represents Key-Value pair
4.Duplicate keys are not allowed but values are allowed


HashMap
1.Hashmap is a class which implements Map Interface
2.Duplicate keys are not allowed but values are allowed. If keys are duplicate, then the values will be overridden
3.Uses Hashing technique to store elements
4.Only one NULL insertion is allowed. If keys are duplicate null, then the values will be overridden
5.Insertion order is not maintained
6.A value of the map is fetched by using its key
7.Initial capacity - 16


LinkedHashMap
1.The only difference between hashmap and linkedhashmap is it maintains insertion order
2.Duplicate keys are not allowed but values are allowed. If keys are duplicate, then the values will be overridden
3.Uses Hashing technique to store elements
4.Only one NULL insertion is allowed. If keys are duplicate null, then the values will be overridden
5.A value of the map is fetched by using its key
6.Initial capacity - 16


TreeMap
1.Treemap is a class which implements Map Interface
2.Duplicate keys are not allowed but values are allowed. If keys are duplicate, then the values will be overridden 
3.Null key is not allowed
4.The elements will be retrieved based on natural sorting order

COLLECTIONS

It is a group of individual objects. 
Collection is a interface which was implemeneted by List, Set and Queue
The List interface is implemented by classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, STack and Vector
Set interface is implemented by classes such as Hashset, LinkedHashset and Treeset

ArrayList:
1. ArrayList maintains insertion order and duplicate elements
2. Null insertion is possible here
3. It returns -1 if the element is not present
4. Using List iterator, we traverse both forward and previous
5. It is non-synchronized and not used in multi threading 
6. The data structure is resizable array or growable
7. It can insert heterogeneous elements provided generics not used
8. Default capacity - 10
9. Best suited for search ops and performs worst for insertion and deletion
10. Implements RandomAccess, Serializable and Cloneable


LinkedList
1. Unlike Arraylist, it is not best suited for search operation and RandomAccess
2. It is useful in insertion and deletion of elements
3. It also allows insertion order and null elements

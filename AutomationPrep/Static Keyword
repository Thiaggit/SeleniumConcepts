Static
Static is a keyword which can given to any variable, method, block and class
No object can not claim a static variable.
The static member belongs to class instead of one particular variable
A static member can be called without object
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly

Static method
A static method can be called in main method by using its name without creating any object
A non static method can also call static method but a static method can not call non static method

Static Block
It is used to initialize the static variable
Gets executed when the class is loaded i.e., it has highest precedence than main class
A class can have any number of static blocks

Static Variable
It is common to all the instances of the class 
Only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class

Static class
A class can be made static only if it is a nested class
